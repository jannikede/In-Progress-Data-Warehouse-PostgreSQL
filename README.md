# Data Warehouse – Portfolio Project (in Progress)


Example of building a modern Data Warehouse using PostgreSQL – ETL, modelling, analytics


The basic requirements that are going into this project are:
1. Import Data from source systems
2. Resolve data quality issues
3. Merge sources into one integrated data model
4. Scope: focus on latest dataset only – no historization
5. Create documentation/manual


### Architecture:
This Warehouse follows the Medallion-Architecture
